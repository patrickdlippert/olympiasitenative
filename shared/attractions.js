        description: "These mysterious mounds inspire imagination and speculation among visitors. With a half-mile ADA accessible path and another two miles of more rugged wandering, the Mima Mounds are a great destination for many hikers. Just what created these odd, bubble-like mounds southwest of Olympia is a mystery. And this puzzle is one with proposed answers ranging from giant gophers to earthquakes and glaciation, as well as extraterrestrial activity. Whatever the answer, the Mima Mounds Natural Area Preserve is a great place for walking or hiking, particularly in the spring when the wildflowers are in bloom on the rolling hills.",

Located in the heart of the Thurston County prairie lands just a few miles south of Olympia, near Tenino, Washington, the park is designated as a primitive park with walk in, bike in, access from the Chehalis Western Trail. The park will continue its legacy of fine art and sculpture in nature. Monarch is a part of the Thurston County Bountiful Byways project. Its neighbors include the internationally renowned Wolf Haven and the new Great Wolf Lodge. Pets are welcome but must be leashed at and cleaned up after."
